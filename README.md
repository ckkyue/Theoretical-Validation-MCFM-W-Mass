# Theoretical-Validation-MCFM-W-Mass
This repository contains files for analyzing MCFM fixed-order calculations of Z, W+, and W- dileptonic decays.
# Data
The Data folder contains the files related to the analysis of MCFM calculations.
# Data/PDFs
The Data/PDFs subfolder contains codes that study the two PDF sets used in MCFM: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118 and MSHT20nnlo_as118.
Additionally, a perturbative toy PDF model is constructed and compared with the PDF sets.
# MCFM-10.3
The MCFM-10.3 folder contains codes that define input configurations and binning of histograms produced in MCFM.
